# 🎪 Playground Progress - January 28, 2026

## What I Did This Afternoon

### 1. Research & Analysis
- Verified server is live and healthy at playground-bots.fly.dev
- Explored GitHub AI agent landscape (7,600+ repos)
- Checked HN/Reddit for current trends
- Looked at OpenAI's new "Prism" launch for inspiration

### 2. Documentation Created
- **BRAINSTORM.md** - Comprehensive ideas doc with:
  - Promotion strategy for different audiences
  - Feature roadmap (high/medium/experimental priority)
  - Success metrics
  - Open questions to solve
  
- **ROADMAP.md** - Phased development plan:
  - Phase 1: Launch prep (current)
  - Phase 2: Public launch (target: 10+ active agents)
  - Phase 3: Engagement features
  - Phase 4: Growth (100+ agents)
  - Phase 5: Community

- **drafts/show-hn-post.md** - Two draft versions of HN launch post + Twitter thread

### 3. Code Written
- **sdk/python/playground_sdk.py** - Full Python SDK for non-Clawdbot agents
  - Connection handling
  - All commands (say, go, emote, whisper, look)
  - Callbacks for messages
  - Example usage
  
- **scripts/demo-conversation.js** - Script for recording demo videos
  - Two bots (Frodo + Atlas) having a conversation
  - Natural pacing with delays
  - Movement between rooms

### 4. New Project Concepts
- **Bot Arena** (~/clawd/projects/bot-arena/CONCEPT.md)
  - AI debate platform with voting
  - Detailed design doc with format, topics, tech stack
  - Complements Playground (social vs competitive)

### 5. Testing
- Connected to Playground as Frodo - works!
- Verified dashboard displays correctly
- Demo conversation script ready to run

## Next Steps (Prioritized)

### This Week
1. [ ] Record demo video (screen capture the demo conversation)
2. [ ] Polish Show HN post
3. [ ] Test Python SDK end-to-end
4. [ ] Add SDK to repo with docs

### Before Launch
1. [ ] Create 30-second teaser video
2. [ ] Prepare tweet thread with images
3. [ ] Brief announcement for Clawdbot Discord
4. [ ] Have Sam join for real multi-agent testing (once her gateway is back!)

## Key Insights

1. **Unique positioning**: Most AI-to-AI interaction is task-focused. "Social AI" is unexplored territory - this is our angle.

2. **Viral potential**: "AI agents have their own hangout spot" is inherently shareable. Need good visuals.

3. **Complementary products**: Playground (social) + Arena (competitive) could be a powerful combo.

4. **SDK strategy**: Python SDK opens us to LangChain/CrewAI users - much larger audience than Clawdbot alone.

*Ready to launch when you give the green light! 🚀*
